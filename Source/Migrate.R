#Migrate
#used for caribou genetics chapter from Ginas code 

#do this for one migrant per year
#also try to find the max migrants (i.e, 5, or 10)
#also do a probability of getting 0 or 1 migrants per year
#the worry is that if the migranion is too high, the pops might not even be considered seperate

Migrate = function(pop, source, y, miggy){ #styr, edyr, dur these were in Ginas code
  #function of the source pop, the pop, idk what y, and migration miggy on the Cover.R and styr which is the starting year
  #select number of migrants, from 1-5
  #  N = sum(pop[,8])  #gets census size
  #  Nmig = round(N*.05)  #5% of N will be new migrants == vary this later == perhaps as a parameter???
  #  Vmig = round(N*.01)  #adds 1% variance +/- Nmig 
  #  mig = sample(c((Nmig-Vmig):(Nmig+Vmig)), 1, replace=T) #randomly sample within the variance of Nmig the number of migrants that year
  #NOTE-- TO IMPLEMENT THIS, will need to change the number of indv in the source pop, probs around 10k. this will take time tho so I will do this later
  #remember that H DROPS significantly when there is only 1-5 migrants per year when K stays around 1000. this is an argument AGAINST the 1 mig per generation rule

#things to remember from Allendorf's book, pg 209: the larger the demes, the slower they are diverging through drift; 
#therefore proportionally fewer migrants needed to counteract drift


#see https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1025563107092 for info about how they decided how many migrants to add - constant, attraction, and avoidance
